Do you know sql database design? Did you read up on any?

the database is built up.. but i dont know how to use the "Insert into...." code

ok. To confirm. The tables you built so far are:

1. Admin <= not going to use anymore because i built the userRole in users table. <= good. This is the right way. You should drop this table later.
2. Users

Correct?

Ok. Now, I see so many files open. Can you show me the code that you use to "login" for both admin & users. Please close the others.
index.php is the login page.
